				<p>Noli Me Tangere, written by José Rizal and initially released in Spanish in 1887, was a significant work in Philippine political history. By utilizing personal experience, nineteenth-century novel traditions, and European liberal ideals, Rizal demonstrated a harmful society ruled by Spain through literature.
				<br><br>
				The protagonist of the story is Crisostomo Ibarra, the mixed-race heir of a prosperous clan who comes back home after seven years in Europe with plans for improving the situation of his fellow citizens. As he works for reforms, he encounters an oppressive church hierarchy and an ignorant and harsh Spanish civil administration. Through story twists, the book implies that significant change in this setting is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
				<br><br>
				Don Rafael, Ibarra's father, passed away before he could return home, and when parish priest Padre Damaso refused to bury him in a Catholic cemetery, Ibarra became enraged and assaulted the priest, for which he was excommunicated. But when the governor general steps in, the decree is revoked. The friar and Padre Salvi, his successor, represent the corrupt status of the clergy. They are determined to stop Ibarra's intentions for a school despite their conflicting feelings—one paternal, the other carnal—for Maria Clara, Ibarra's sweetheart and the wealthy Capitan Tiago's lovely daughter. The town philosopher Tasio observes cynically that previous attempts of a similar nature have failed, and his insightful commentary reveals that all colonial masters worry that a people enlightened will lift the burden of oppression.
				<br><br>
				The main topic of the book is exactly how to do this, and Ibarra discusses it with the enigmatic Elias, whose life he is connected to. Elias, who has seen injustice at the hands of the government, feels that violence is the only choice, while wealthy Ibarra advocates nonviolent measures.
				<br><br>
				Although the evidence against Ibarra is weak, his enemies—Salvi in particular—claim that he is involved in a false uprising. Then Maria Clara betrays him in order to keep a sinister family secret that would be disastrous to reveal to the public. With Elias's assistance, Ibarra breaks out of prison and approaches her. Ibarra pardons her once she explains why, and he and Elias take out for the lake. However, one perishes and the other lives as they are pursued by the Guardia Civil. Maria Clara enters the nunnery, convinced that Ibarra has passed away, and she declines the Padre Damaso-arranged marriage. Her terrible destiny and that of the more famous Sisa, who was driven insane by her sons' fate, represent the dual beauty and misery of the nation.
				<br><br>
				Through clever use of sarcasm, Rizal crafts other charming personas whose lives serve as living examples of the destructive consequences of colonial and religious persecution. A tiny snapshot of Philippine society, Capitan Tiago, the social climber Doña Victorina de Espadaña and her toothless Spanish husband, the head of the Guardia Civil and his harridan of a wife, the sorority of devout women, and enraged peasants forced to become outlaws. In a work that speaks powerfully to everyone who has experienced or watched persecution, Rizal creates a horrifying image of his beloved but suffering homeland in the sufferings that befall them.

				<p>Noli Me Tangere's sequel, El Filibusterismo, is José Rizal's second and last completed novel (but he left the unfinished text of a third one behind). Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra remains the protagonist of the widely known novel, known as the Fili, which is a dark, brooding, and occasionally sarcastic tale of tragedy, unrequited love, and retribution. Thirteen years older, his idealism and childhood ambitions dashed, he disguises himself as Simoun, an incredibly wealthy and intriguing jeweler who has won the trust of the colony's governor-general, by taking advantage of the notion that he passed away at the conclusion of Noli Me Tangere.
				<br><br>
				Several other characters from the Noli make reappearances: Basilio, whose mother and younger brother Crispin met unfortunate ends; Father Salví, the manipulative former curate of San Diego who had desired after Ibarra's love, María Clara; the idealistic schoolmaster from San Diego; Captain Tiago, a rich widower and María Clara's legal father; and Doña Victorina de Espadaña and her Spanish spouse, the fake doctor Tiburcio, who was now hiding from her with the indio priest Father Florentino at his isolated parish on the Pacific coast.
				<br><br>
				While Ibarra had persuasively argued against using violence to transform Manila society, Simoun is willing to use violence to get revenge on Father Salví and the Spanish colonial government. His aspirations are to free the islands from Spanish rule and his true love, María Clara, from the confining existence of an isolated nun. In his capacity as the governor-general's confidant, he gives him advice on how to further oppress the state in the hopes of inciting a popular uprising. A few criminals, including the schoolteacher and Quiroga, a Chinese trader, help Simoun plot terrorist activities. All things considered, Simoun has developed into a major agent troublemaker.
				<br><br>
				A team of college students, including Isagani, Peláez, and Makaraig, advocate for the establishment of an academy dedicated to teaching Castilian in accordance with a Madrid order, in contrast to Simoun's route of military revolution. Even with their benign opposition, the friars are able to co-opt the scheme. The students are then charged with being the source of flyers encouraging revolt against the government. The majority of observers attribute the entire situation to the friars, which leads to the arrest of the student leaders—including Basilio, despite his lack of involvement—and the dissolution of the relationship between Isagani and the gorgeous Paulita Gómez, who consents to wed the wealthy Peláez, much to the pleasure of Doña Victorina, who has always supported him.
				<br><br>
				While Father Irene takes care to Tiago, who is addicted to opium, he overdoses on drugs and passes away. Basilio receives a small inheritance, and all of the other students who are in prison are soon released. Julí goes to Father Camorra and asks him to get Basilio released. The friar tries to rape her, but she kills herself instead of giving in to his sexual intentions. Having been released from prison, Basilio, who is one of the few people who truly knows Simoun, reluctantly joins the latter's scheme after learning of Julí's death and the subsequent decline in his chances.
				<br><br>
				Simoun's true identity is finally exposed after the planned revolt is called off, in part because of a note he writes for Father Salví during the feast. After being hurt, he escapes and takes cover at Father Florentino's house. He tells the priest what he has done before taking his own life there. He leaves his bag of gems behind, and the good father tosses it into the water, commanding the priceless stones to reveal themselves until when the nation requires them for a "holy, noble reason."
