			<p>The pride of the people and the national hero of the Philippines, Jose Rizal, was born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19, 1861. Of an 11-kid family consisting of 2 boys and 9 girls, he was the seventh child. Both of his parents had advanced degrees and came from well-to-do families. His mother, Teodora Alonzo y Quintos, was born in Meisic, Sta. Cruz. On the other hand, his father, Francisco Mercado Rizal, was a diligent farmer from Bi√±an, Laguna, who Rizal called "a model of fathers."
			<br><br>
			His mother taught him the alphabet when he was three years old, and even as he was learning to read and write, he began to express an interest in becoming an artist. He amazed his family and friends with his clay molds and pencil illustrations and doodles. His poem "Sa Aking Mga Kabata," written in Tagalog when he was eight years old, has as its central theme the love of one's own language.
			<br><br>
			He received a "excellent" average for his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1877, when he was sixteen years old. He enrolled in Philosophy and Letters at the University of Santo Tomas in the same year that he also took courses at the Ateneo leading to the surveyor and expert assessor degrees. After completing the later course on March 21, 1877, and passing the surveyor's exam on May 21, 1878, he was only allowed to practice as a licensed professional until December 30, 1881, due to his age of seventeen. He entered in the University of Santo Tomas in 1878 to study medicine, but he was forced to drop out because he believed that the Dominican instructors there were discriminating against the Filipino students.
			<br><br>
			He set out for Spain on May 3, 1882, where he proceeded to study at the Universidad Central de Madrid. On June 21, 1884, at the age of 23, he was awarded the degree of Licentiate in Medicine, and on June 19, 1885, at the age of 24, he completed his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of "excellent." At the age of 23, he received his Licentiate in Medicine on June 21, 1884, and at the age of 24, he completed his Philosophy and Letters course with a "sobresaliente" mark on June 19, 1885.
			<br><br>
			He was a skilled shooter and a skilled swordsman. The greatest proponent of Filipino nationalism, Rizal, authored a number of works with strong nationalistic and revolutionary overtones while he was living in Europe in an effort to educate his fellow citizens and secure political and social reforms for his homeland.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="margin-left: -2px; width: 1250px;">Jose Rizal was tried by the military court on December 26, 1896, and was subsequently found guilty of sedition, conspiracy, and rebellion. The works of Rizal, according to the Spanish authorities, "fatally and necessarily" inspired the revolt, which by 1896 had already turned into a revolution. Capt. Rafael Dominguez punished Rizal with a death sentence on December 29 at six in the morning. The following day was his scheduled execution.
			<br><br>
			At seven in the morning, a fire squad shot the 35-year-old patriot in the back on December 30, 1896, in Luneta, Manila. Pronouncing "Consummatum Est," which translates to "It is done," he paused, turned halfway toward his executioners, then collapsed upon his back to confront the sun of the Philippines.</p>
