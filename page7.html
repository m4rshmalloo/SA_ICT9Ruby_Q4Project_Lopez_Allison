This movie really made me see Disney movies a little different, I've never seen anything like it! What's not to love, talking animals, magic, sword fighting, creatures, and epic wars! Narnia is one of my top favorite fantasy places, next to Hogwarts, middle Earth. I always love watching Narnia movie around Christmas t8me. I always cry on this movie."<br><br><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning active"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/">See More!</a></button></td>

							<td>Ratings: 4.8/5 ☆<br><br>Anonymous Review:<br>"An astoundingly funny and an absolute classic as the original sitcom but with a new flavor to it. It might be the most underrated comedy of all time. Rowan Atkinson is a comic legend as usual with his unbelievably funny physical comedy. Well written, well directed and perfectly acted Mr. Bean's Holiday is a feast for both original sitcom fans and new comers."<br><br><button type="button" class="btn btn-warning active"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453451/">See More!</a></button></td>
